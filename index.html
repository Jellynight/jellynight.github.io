    The question that he frames in all but words
    is what to make of a diminished penis.
    Flasid in nature, hard in confinement. 
    The penis is gods last bastion for rebellion. 
    Rebelling nature itself one would say. Is that even possible? 
    Alas, nature has not bounds, no limits. 
    Completly unchained is the member that it defies nature, the limitless.
